                        <p>Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways 
                           to simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking 
                           a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already living.

                                <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you 
                                   have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking 
                                   nice and simple.

                                <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their 
                                   relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as 
                                   simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

                                <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, 
                                   or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying 
                                   simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never 
                                   before.
